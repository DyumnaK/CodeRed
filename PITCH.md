# SkillLadder - A Website That Gives Voice to the Invisible Workforce

In India, millions of skilled and semi-skilled workers go unseen — not because they lack ability, but because they lack digital access.

SkillLadder is a web platform that lets workers speak their skills, upload photos of their work, and get matched to local jobs — all in their own language, with just a few taps.

Our site supports voice-to-text, photo uploads, and local notifications. It’s built for users with low digital literacy, low-end devices, and limited internet.

No complex forms. No resumes. Just visibility, connection, and opportunity.

SkillLadder isn’t just a website. It’s a movement for inclusion, dignity, and livelihood — one job, one voice at a time.
