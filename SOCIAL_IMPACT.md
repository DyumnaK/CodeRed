# Project Pitch

This project is an AI-driven, voice- and image-enabled job platform designed to connect blue-collar and gig workers with local job opportunities. Unlike conventional portals, it eliminates literacy, technical, and language barriers by allowing users to register, upload profiles, and apply for jobs through voice commands, photos, and large-button interactions — all from a basic smartphone.

Our goal is to make employment **inclusive, accessible, and dignified** for millions of underrepresented workers across rural and urban India.


# Social Impact

- **Bridges the Digital Divide**  
  By enabling voice and visual interactions, the platform allows semi-literate or non-literate users to participate in the digital job economy.

- **Empowers Informal Workers**  
  Offers accessible employment tools for domestic workers, construction laborers, delivery agents, and more — groups often excluded from traditional job systems.

- **Local, Inclusive Hiring**  
  Promotes nearby job listings, reducing forced migration and empowering people to work closer to home — especially useful for women, caregivers, and marginalized communities.

- **Supports NGO/Govt Integration**  
  Can be scaled for skilling missions, rural employment schemes, or nonprofit programs to track workers and offer verified opportunities.



# ♿ Accessibility Statement

Our platform is intentionally designed to be **accessible for low-literacy and grassroots users** by following these principles:

- **Voice Input**  
  Users can speak their name, skill, or job preference — eliminating the need for typing or reading long forms.

- **Image-Based Uploads**  
  Workers can upload profile photos or skill samples (e.g., photos of previous work) instead of written resumes.

- **Pictorial User Guides**  
  The interface uses **icons, symbols, and step-by-step visuals** to guide users through each step of the process.

- **Large Buttons & Simple Layout**  
  Easy-to-tap elements and a mobile-first layout ensure usability even on small screens and basic smartphones.

- **Multi-Language Support** *(Planned)*  
  Regional language support is in progress to serve users in their native language, improving comprehension and trust.
